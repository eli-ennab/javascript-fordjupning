1. Create a `services/TheCatAPI.ts` API-client that handles all the logic for communicating with The Cat API <https://developers.thecatapi.com>.

2. Using React Query, show a random cat when visiting the `<RandomCatPage>`-page.

3. Add a button that retrieves a new random cat (using React Query).

4. Show a spinning cat when making a new request.

    Pro-tip: Add a delay to your Axios-request to simulate a slow API so you have a chance of actually seeing the loading spinner.
